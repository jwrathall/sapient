Code assessment for Sapient.

Each sample app is written in javascript. To run them, have node installed, navigate to the folder via the command line and 
type in "node app.js"

The app will log out the correct output.

To be fair, I tried to spend the suggested amount of time on each example however, I did go over the time limit.
